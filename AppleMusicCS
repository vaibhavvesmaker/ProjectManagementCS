## 🔹 Machine Learning Model for Personalized Playlists  

A **random forest classifier** was used to analyze **user listening habits** and generate personalized playlist recommendations.  

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load Apple Music user behavior dataset
data = pd.read_csv("user_behavior.csv")

# Features: Listening time, skips, likes, replays
X = data[["listening_time", "skips", "likes", "replays"]]
y = data["playlist_recommendation"]

# Train a recommendation model
model = RandomForestClassifier().fit(X, y)

# Predict recommended playlist for a user
user_behavior = [[120, 3, 5, 8]]  # 120 mins listening, 3 skips, 5 likes, 8 replays
print("🎵 Recommended Playlist:", model.predict(user_behavior))
```

📊 **Outcome:** Higher engagement & increased time spent per session.
